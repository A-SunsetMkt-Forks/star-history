As the de-facto site to check GitHub star history, [star-history.com](/) has been growing steadily over the 
year. Today, it is welcoming 30,000+ unique visitors every month.

Comparing to other sites, this is a very small visitor numbers, while the open source talents density
is high. Many popular GitHub projects, in particular, from the recent AI wave, have also embedded our live
chart in their README.

Last year, we also started [Starlet List](/blog/list-your-open-source-project), a free program to promote
open source projects. Since then, we have received a lot of open source project nominations and have
compiled 18 issues.

To scale the community, today we introduce another endeavor, the star history forum at https://forum.star-history.com.
To retain the sketchy spirit, we use the discourse classic theme to build the forum.

Hope you like it and looking forward to seeing all the amazing open source gigs there!
